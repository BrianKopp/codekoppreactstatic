# Welcome to CodeKopp

This is the first of many blog posts written to catalog and demonstrate the different projects I've executed over time. These posts strive to contain educational content as well, highlighting lessons learned, tips & tricks, etc.

## My Background

Growing up, math & science always came easy for me. I have always felt comfortable tackling new problems, decomposing them into smaller pieces, and worknig through them. At Kansas State University, when I wasn't playing trombone in The Pride of Wildcat Land, I studied Mechanical & Nuclear Engineering. A part-time research job introduced me to numerical methods in C++, helping to land me a job with Black & Veatch using and supporting a C++ MFC application. 

## Always Learning

Being a self-taught developer, I have never stopped learning. New languages brought new concepts, or made clearer concepts that were opaque in other languages. From C++ I made the short jump to C#, bringing me into my group's main development team supporting a .NET application. I've branched out to many other technologies from VBA, Java, PHP, Objective C, Swift, to Python (what I want to write when I grow up). 

## My Love Language

I entered the programming world in C++ with no idea what I was doing. Pointers, pointers to pointers, header files, linkers, all these things baffled me. Over time, the mysteries were solved, but the headache remained. One day during a Gurobi (optimizer) training event, my interest was piqued when everyone wouldn't stop talking about this python thing. Interpreted? Psh, couldn't ever be fast enough. Dynamically typed? What is this, matlab? After seeing what the world could look like without semi-colons and curly brackets, I began to listen. I had been decyphering cryptic fortran-style variables (e.g. aa, rg) for years, so when I saw an actually readable language, I was quite interested. After seeing what it meant to be batteries included, I was sold. Why would you write a units-conversion library? pip install pint. Need to scrape a website for data? BeautifulSoup. Data manipulation? pandas, numpy. Sold. Pythonista. Python Evangelist. "The Python Guy". This is me.

## Back to Front

Always a back-end developer and despising javascript & CSS, I never spent much time mastering the front-end frameworks. At my day job, we use Angular, which makes me die inside a little every time I use it. With this current undertaking, I have discovered React, which at first glance, seems like an actually readable javascript library. We shall see.....

## The Gorilla

I'm also undertaking to learn the ropes of different important Amazon Web Services technologies. IoT, Lambda, Greengrass, S3, CloudFormation, Route53, APIGateway, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, SQS. These are some tools I have dabbled with. This site alone uses Route53, S3, CloudFormation, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline. Subdomains will use APIGateway to read IoT data from DynamoDB via Lambda functions. I must learn everything I can.
