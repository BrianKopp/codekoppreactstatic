# Smart Garage Door

At work, I'm learning about AWS technologies and IoT devices. IoT is short for Internet-of-Things, basically just devices that can communicate with the internet. IoT has exploded onto the scene in the past several years with the prevalence of low-cost internet-connected devices. I'm looking at you *Raspberry Pi*. For 30 smackers, you can have a quad-core linux computer with 1GB of RAM, wifi, bluetooth, 4 USB drives, and more. Don't care about lots of USB or quad-core? Go snag a $10 Raspberry Pi Zero, which is what I did.

AWS has great tutorials to get started with 'Hello, World' examples, but ultimately, I wanted to work through a **real** application of AWS and IoT. How could I use this little device? Garage door! Garage doors are reasonably simple things, and this would be a great way to start out learning about the AWS stack as well as brush the dust off of my circuitry skills.

## Objectives

My Smart Garage Door will need to have/do certain things.

* Raspberry Pi Zero device located in garage
* * Device can tell if garage door is open or closed
* * Device can open/close garage door
* Simple web application hosted by AWS
* * User can log in and see or update garage door state
* * User can see history of garage door actions

Many more posts will be coming on this topic, with specific examples what I'm learning and how exactly these things are done.
