# Version 1 is Deployed!

After many hours of debugging API Gateway and React, the first version of the garage door website is up and running! From any web browser, I can see the status of my garage door, its history, and request changes to its position. I haven't yet installed my physical device and electronics, but that is the easy part compared to the rest of the AWS technologies.

In the next several blog posts, I will lay out the exact methods that I used to create the back-end and web-client to make this project possible.
