# Complete 180

I thought I hated Angular. Boy, was I wrong.

## Background

I am relatively new to modern javascript frameworks. My first exposure to them was at work where have a large AngularJS application. Controllers with 2k+ lines of spaghetti code were everywhere. I wanted **nothing** to do with it.

## Foray into React

I knew I needed to learn about web frameworks, so I set out to learn one. Angular was definitely out, obviously. React looked pretty straightforward, so I picked that up. Everything is nice and simple. There is good code organization. Components keep things concise. No 2,000 line controller code, check. No spaghetti code, check. I spent some time in React and got pretty comfortable. I built this website using react-static.

## New Horizons

Then my employer gave me the option to go to ngDenver. I was excited because I love conferences, but was very apprehensive because I've felt so out of my element looking at our AngularJS application at work. My fear was that Angular was all like our AngularJS app. I didn't even know there was a difference between Angular and AngularJS. Doh!

## The Grass is Definitely Greener

Let's just say, I am fully, 100% on board and excited about Angular now!

I signed up for classes the two days leading up to the conference, covering Angular basics and advanced concepts. Boy, was I suprised to find out that the concepts and design patterns were so similar to React. Small components. Deterministic views. Code organization. Presentation vs. container components. The thing I had loved about working in React was that there was a strong opinion about how things *should* be done. Same over in Angular, and perhaps even more so. **Fantastic!** I'd much rather work on code that follows practices and opinions of folks way smarter than me, as opposed to winging it and ending up with what we have currently at work.

## The Long Slog

One of the goals of sending two of my coworkers and me to the conference was to judge whether we though there was enough value in upgrading from AngularJS to Angular 6. Our impression was a unanimous "Yes". Now that we think so, we have to start thinking about how to upgrade. It may be a long, grueling process, but our app will be faster, more testable, and much, **much** more pleasurable to maintain.
